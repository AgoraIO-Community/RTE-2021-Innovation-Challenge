| Configure the site
|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
|
| A Flarum site represents your local installation of Flarum. It can be
| configured with a bunch of paths:
|
| - The *base path* is Flarum's root directory and contains important files
|   such as config.php and extend.php.
| - The *public path* is the directory that serves as document root for the
|   web server. Files in this place are accessible to the public internet.
|   This is where assets such as JavaScript files or CSS stylesheets need to
|   be stored in a default install.
| - The *storage path* is a place for Flarum to store files it generates during
|   runtime. This could be caches, session data or other temporary files.
|
| The fully configured site instance is returned to the including script, which
| then uses it to boot up the Flarum application and e.g. accept web requests.
