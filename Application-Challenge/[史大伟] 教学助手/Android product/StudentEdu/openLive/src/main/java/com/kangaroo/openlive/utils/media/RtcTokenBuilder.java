     * The privileges for publishing audio, video, and data streams in an RTC channel apply only if you have

     *
     * A user can have multiple privileges. Each privilege is valid for a maximum of 24 hours.
     * The SDK triggers the onTokenPrivilegeWillExpire and onRequestToken callbacks when the token is about to expire
     * or has expired. The callbacks do not report the specific privilege affected, and you need to maintain
     * the respective timestamp for each privilege in your app logic. After receiving the callback, you need
     * to generate a new token, and then call renewToken to pass the new token to the SDK, or call joinChannel to re-join
     * the channel.
     *
     * @note
     * Agora recommends setting a reasonable timestamp for each privilege according to your scenario.
     * Suppose the expiration timestamp for joining the channel is set earlier than that for publishing audio.
