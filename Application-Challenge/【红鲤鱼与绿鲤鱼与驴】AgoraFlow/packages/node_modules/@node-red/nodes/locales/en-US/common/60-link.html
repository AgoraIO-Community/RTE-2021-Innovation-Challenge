    <p>Create virtual wires between flows.</p>
    <h3>Details</h3>
    <p>The node can be connected to any <code>link out</code> node that exists on any tab.
       Once connected, they behave as if they were wired together.</p>
    <p>The wires between link nodes are only displayed when a link node is selected.
       If there are any wires to other tabs, a virtual node is shown that can be clicked
       on to jump to the appropriate tab.</p>
    <p><b>Note: </b>Links cannot be created going into, or out of, a subflow.</p>
