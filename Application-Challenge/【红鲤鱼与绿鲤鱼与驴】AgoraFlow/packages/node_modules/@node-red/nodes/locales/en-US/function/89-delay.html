<script type="text/html" data-help-name="delay">
    <p>Delays each message passing through the node or limits the rate at which they can pass.</p>
    <h3>Inputs</h3>
    <dl class="message-properties">
        <dt class="optional">delay <span class="property-type">number</span></dt>
        <dd>Sets the delay, in milliseconds, to be applied to the message. This
            option only applies if the node is configured to allow the message to
            override the configured default delay interval.</dd>
        <dt class="optional">reset</dt>
        <dd>If the received message has this property set to any value, all
            outstanding messages held by the node are cleared without being sent.</dd>
        <dt class="optional">flush</dt>
        <dd>If the received message has this property set to any value, all
            outstanding messages held by the node are sent immediately.</dd>
    </dl>
    <h3>Details</h3>
    <p>When configured to delay messages, the delay interval can be a fixed value,
        a random value within a range or dynamically set for each message.
        Each message is delayed independently of any other message, based on 
        the time of its arrival.
    </p>
    <p>When configured to rate limit messages, their delivery is spread across
        the configured time period. The status shows the number of messages currently in the queue.
        It can optionally discard intermediate messages as they arrive.</p>
    </p>
    <p>The rate limiting can be applied to all messages, or group them according to
        their <code>msg.topic</code> value. When grouping, intermerdiate messages are
        automatically dropped. At each time interval, the node can either release
        the most recent message for all topics, or release the most recent message
        for the next topic.
    </p>
