<script type="text/html" data-help-name="file">
    <p>Writes <code>msg.payload</code> to a file, either adding to the end or replacing the existing content.
       Alternatively, it can delete the file.</p>
    <h3>Inputs</h3>
    <dl class="message-properties">
        <dt class="optional">filename <span class="property-type">string</span></dt>
        <dd>If not configured in the node, this optional property sets the name of the file to be updated.</dd>
        <dt class="optional">encoding <span class="property-type">string</span></dt>
        <dd>If encoding is configured to be set by msg, then this optional property can set the encoding.</dt>
    </dl>
    <h3>Output</h3>
    <p>On completion of write, input message is sent to output port.</p>
    <h3>Details</h3>
    <p>Each message payload will be added to the end of the file, optionally appending
    a newline (\n) character between each one.</p>
    <p>If <code>msg.filename</code> is used the file will be closed after every write.
    For best performance use a fixed filename.</p>
    <p>It can be configured to overwrite the entire file rather than append. For example,
    when writing binary data to a file, such as an image, this option should be used
    and the option to append a newline should be disabled.</p>
    <p>Encoding of data written to a file can be specified from list of encodings.</p>
    <p>Alternatively, this node can be configured to delete the file.</p>
</script>

<script type="text/html" data-help-name="file in">
    <p>Reads the contents of a file as either a string or binary buffer.</p>
    <h3>Inputs</h3>
    <dl class="message-properties">
        <dt class="optional">filename <span class="property-type">string</span></dt>
        <dd>if not set in the node configuration, this property sets the filename to read.</dd>
    </dl>
    <h3>Outputs</h3>
    <dl class="message-properties">
        <dt>payload <span class="property-type">string | buffer</span></dt>
        <dd>The contents of the file as either a string or binary buffer.</dd>
        <dt class="optional">filename <span class="property-type">string</span></dt>
        <dd>If not configured in the node, this optional property sets the name of the file to be read.</dd>
    </dl>
    <h3>Details</h3>
    <p>The filename should be an absolute path, otherwise it will be relative to
    the working directory of the Node-RED process.</p>
    <p>On Windows, path separators may need to be escaped, for example: <code>\\Users\\myUser</code>.</p>
    <p>Optionally, a text file can be split into lines, outputting one message per line, or a binary file
    split into smaller buffer chunks - the chunk size being operating system dependant, but typically 64k (Linux/Mac) or 41k (Windows).</p>
    <p>When split into multiple messages, each message will have a <code>parts</code>
    property set, forming a complete message sequence.</p>
    <p>Encoding of input data can be specified from list of encodings if output format is string.</p>
    <p>Errors should be caught and handled using a Catch node.</p>
