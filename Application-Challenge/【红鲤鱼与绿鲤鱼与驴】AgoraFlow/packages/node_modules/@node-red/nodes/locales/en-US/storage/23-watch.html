<script type="text/html" data-help-name="watch">
    <p>Watches a directory or file for changes.</p>
    <p>You can enter a list of comma separated directories and/or files. You will
    need to put quotes "..." around any that have spaces in.</p>
    <p>On Windows you must use double back-slashes \\ in any directory names.</p>
    <p>The full filename of the file that actually changed is put into <code>msg.payload</code> and <code>msg.filename</code>,
    while a stringified version of the watch list is returned in <code>msg.topic</code>.</p>
    <p><code>msg.file</code> contains just the short filename of the file that changed.
    <code>msg.type</code> has the type of thing changed, usually <i>file</i> or <i>directory</i>,
    while <code>msg.size</code> holds the file size in bytes.</p>
    <p>Of course in Linux, <i>everything</i> is a file and thus can be watched...</p>
    <p><b>Note: </b>The directory or file must exist in order to be watched. If the file
    or directory gets deleted it may no longer be monitored even if it gets re-created.</p>
