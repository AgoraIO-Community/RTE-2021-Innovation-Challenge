# RTE 2021 Innovation Challenge

*English* | [**中文**](README.zh.md)

## Introduction
RTE (Real Time Engagement) Innovative Programming Challenge is an online hackathon for RTC developers, programming enthusiasts and geeks around the world, which has been held by Agora since 2019.

In this year's competition, we have two tracks, and we will continue the application innovation track with the theme of "Developing Applications with Agora SDK". At the same time, this year we also launched a special technology innovation track, "Develop self-developed plug-ins and functional demos using the plug-in interface of Cloud Market", which will give developers higher requirements and unique technology innovation space to expand the boundaries of RTC technology capabilities.

The competition will continue to be conducted in the way of "online programming + online submission + online final". We hope that while pursuing application innovation and technology innovation, the contestants will solve practical problems in academia, business and society, and create more value for society with technology.

## Application Innovation Track: Developing Applications with Agora SDK

In the context of the global epidemic, RTC technology is rapidly being used in video conferencing, online education, video conferencing, online medical and other real-time interactive scenarios. And we believe RTC technology can do much more than that.
In this track, you can use Agora SDK to empower more scenarios with real-time audio and video interaction, and you can also win a prize with these innovations.

### Requirements
- Develop an application using any of Agora SDKs. The SDKs used can be audio/video calling/live streaming SDKs, cloud signaling SDKs, instant messaging SDKs, interactive whiteboard SDKs, recording SDKs, interactive game SDKs, real-time stream acceleration SDKs, and other SDK products officially released by the official website. For details, please refer to the Agora Developer Center: [https://docs.agora.io/cn](https://docs.agora.io/cn)
- Entries developed using any of the Agora SDKs in combination with the Huanxin IM SDK will additionally be eligible for the "Huanxin Special Award". For more information on the Huanxin IM SDK, please visit: [http://docs-im.easemob.com/](http://docs-im.easemob.com/)
- Teams in this competition can choose to develop with Agora Cloud Market SDK and 360 and Xiangxin's Cloud Market plug-ins. The combination can not only realize the conventional audio and video functions, but also expand advanced functions such as background keying and beautification.
- Entries can be based on ideas for new application development, or updated and modified based on existing projects that have not been commercialized by individuals. Entries based on existing projects must include a detailed description of the main changes in the project's Readme document and be adapted to the latest version of the Agora SDK.
- The application of the entry can be the implementation of an application scenario or the solution of a real-life problem, and the relevant ideas can be referred to previous winning entries.
- The Readme file of your entry should contain a detailed background of the project and a description of its operation.
- Please ensure that your entry is free from any legal or compliance risks and that the materials used in your entry (including but not limited to open source code, images, videos, etc.) are free from copyright issues.
- The source code of your entry is open source under the MIT agreement.

### Submission
- Fork the official repository, to your personal GitHub repository, and Clone the repository locally  
Repository address: https://github.com/AgoraIO-Community/RTE-2021-Innovation-Challenge/tree/master/Application-Challenge 
- Create a new personal project folder under the local SDKChallengeProject folder named "[Team Name] Project Name" and place the files and code for your entry in that folder.
- Submit the content of your entry to the official repository via Pull Request

### Selection of entries
The jury will consider the entries based on various dimensions such as "completion", "creativity" and "potential commercial value".

- Degree of completion (40%)
The degree of realization of the work provided by the participating teams. This includes code quality, visual design integrity, and user experience.
- Creativity (20%)
The degree of innovation of the entries. Whether it is sufficiently innovative and different from similar products in the industry.
- Practicality (20%)
The degree of practical application of the entries in the application scenario. Whether it can match the development demands of users and focus on user experience.
- Potential commercial value (20%)
The commercial value that the entry can generate in daily working life. Whether it can attract industry attention and sufficient influence as well as create market benefits.

## Technology Innovation Track: Using the Agora Cloud Market plug-in interface to develop self-developed plug-ins and functional demo

In order to support the evolution from audio-video real-time communication (RTC) to real-time engagement (RTE), we released the Cloud Market in 2020 to aggregate industry eco-partners, integrate eco-partners' products on the basis of RTC, provide developers with full-scene services, and jointly empower the RTE ecology.

We hope that partners and community developers can easily incorporate their products into the Cloud Market ecology. For this reason, we have encapsulated the Cloud Marketplace plug-in interface on top of Agora Audio and Video SDK. By docking the plug-in transmission interface, we can integrate the third-party plug-in functions into real-time audio and video.

Currently, several partners have successfully integrated video beautification filters, voice changer and other audio and video extension capabilities into the Agora ecosystem through the Cloud Marketplace plug-in interface. We also hope to open the plug-in interface to the community to stimulate more creativity of developers and expand the boundaries of RTC technology capabilities.

### Requirements
- Based on the Cloud Marketplace plug-in system interface provided by Agora, develop a self-developed plug-in that can add audio and video extension capabilities to the Agora audio and video SDK, and complete a demo based on this plug-in to demonstrate the capabilities of the self-developed plug-in.
- We will provide the open source code of the third-party plug-ins packaged by Agora for developers' reference.
- The difficulty of this competition is higher than that of the application innovation track, and the self-developing of the plug-in and the interface of the plug-in system need some C++ language skill.
- The Readme file of the entry should contain detailed project background and running instructions.
- Please ensure that your entry is free from any legal or compliance risks and that the materials used in your entry (including but not limited to open source code, images, videos, etc.) are free from copyright issues.
- The source code of the entries (including plug-in packages and plug-in based applications) are open source under the MIT license.

### Submission
- Fork the official repository, to your personal GitHub repository, and Clone the repository locally
Repository address: https://github.com/AgoraIO-Community/RTE-2021-Innovation-Challenge/tree/master/Technology-Challenge
- Create a new personal project folder under the local SDKChallengeProject folder named "[Team Name] Project Name" and place the files and code for your entry in that folder.
- Submit the content of your entry to the official repository via Pull Request

### Selection of entries
The jury will consider the entries based on various dimensions such as "code completeness", "documentation completeness", "stability" and "creativity".
The plug-ins and functional demos submitted for this competition must be able to run normally in order to be shortlisted for the subsequent judging.

- Code completeness (40%)
By implementing iVideoFilter and other Agora SDK interfaces, self-developed plug-ins to expand audio and video functions, compile and complete the package, and provide a demo project to demonstrate the functions of the plug-ins
- Creativity (30%)
The degree of innovation and functional richness of the entries. Whether it has sufficient innovation and is different from similar products.
- Stability (20%)
Agora will use automated testing tools to check the stability of the project (100 API calls without crashing)
- Documentation completeness (10%)
Supporting the provision of complete project Readme documentation, which includes the description of the plug-in, functional introduction, call methods, etc.
